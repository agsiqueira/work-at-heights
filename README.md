# Working at Height – Multimodal Training Experience

An AI-powered multimodal training platform that combines conversational learning, adaptive assessments, and immersive virtual reality to support competency-based Working-at-Height (NR-35) training.

The platform integrates conversational learning, adaptive interviewing, knowledge assessment, immersive VR training, and AI-assisted reflective debriefing into a single coordinated learning experience.

## Why this project?

Traditional working-at-height training often separates theoretical instruction from practical exercises. This project explores how conversational AI, adaptive assessment, and immersive virtual reality can be orchestrated into a multimodal training experience that continuously adapts to learner performance across instructional modalities.

The project was developed as a research platform while remaining modular enough to support future industrial deployment.

The desktop application functions as the adaptive orchestration layer, coordinating learner progression while intentionally remaining loosely coupled from both the SmartChats platform and the VR application. The current implementation exchanges standardized reports between subsystems, providing a simple integration mechanism today while establishing a clear migration path toward future API-based interoperability.

---

## Artificial Intelligence

The platform leverages the **University of Florida NaviGator AI APIs**, which provide secure access to multiple state-of-the-art AI models hosted on **HiPerGator**, the University of Florida's high-performance computing infrastructure.

Current AI capabilities include:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Speech-to-Text (STT)
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)

These services support:

- Adaptive interviewing
- Automated learner assessment
- VR report summarization
- AI-assisted reflective debriefing
- Natural voice interaction

Because AI capabilities are accessed through the NaviGator service layer, the application remains independent of any specific language model.
